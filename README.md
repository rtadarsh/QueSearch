# QueSearch
Browser extension to search all Google Form questions on Google in one click üñ±Ô∏è


During the pandemic, online classes the are only way of completing your college degree, where most of the exams are taken online using Google Forms. Believe it or not, majority of the students just search the questions on Google and if lucky, they get the answers easily. This extension is going to be your helping hand. It can search all questions or a range of questions (as decided by you) on Google in seperate tabs. Though it's a basic script, yet it can save you a few seconds and prevent your submission from getting counted as late.

Just be sure to be soft on your RAM üòÅ
